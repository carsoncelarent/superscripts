Captain Avalanche Issue 1
Intro 

AMD Base, Outpost 05, 122 Miles Southeast of New Sanden
“Give me the report, Carmen. I’m getting calls from the governor, the military, the news, and some ambassador from Zimbabwe or somewhere like that. Why the hell does the Colvon Street overpass look like a giant popsicle right now?” Charlemagne Wester hurried down the crisp metal hallway leading to the observation room. A guard opened the door as he walked through, letting the Commander-in-Chief and his secretary through. 
“We’re just getting information now, sir. Reports claim a masked individual attempted to chase down the Savages’ getaway car in a light gray Ford Mustang. Both vehicles pulled to a stop due to traffic. The masked man exited his car, and blasted them with ice of some sort that he projected from his palms. After a struggle, which ended up encasing a large portion of the overpass in ice, the Savages were subdued and he slipped away.”
“Did you track his car?” 
“His car was wrecked in the chase. He escaped on foot before our drones could follow and disappeared.”
“Plates?”
“He’s either paranoid or smart enough to have pulled them off. It must have been recent.”
Mr. Wester gritted his teeth. Carmen blushed slightly under Mr. Wester’s ire. 
“Find him. I don’t want another masked vigilante running around the biggest city in the states without any supervision.” 
Carmen nodded. She smiled slightly, her pretty face lighting up. “He did stop the Savages, though.”
“...yes he did. But I can’t thank him if I don’t know who he is.”
“Yes sir.”
3 Weeks Earlier
Antarctica, Somewhere near Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station
	Alan Skears trudged through the cold. The bitter cold. The Antarctic chill did its best to seep through his jacket, but he trudged on. The scientists at the base had told him not to go out today. They’d told him that the weather was too dangerous. They obviously didn’t know Alan well enough. All their words had done was spur him on. Alan wasn’t a scientist, to his parent’s dismay. His parents had urged him to attend college for years. He’d caved and acquired an engineering degree from MIT, if only because his father had threatened to stop giving him money. Some called Alan’s lifestyle reckless. Rash. He preferred adventurous. He’d left his father’s massive law firm behind and started out on his own, applying his father’s money to the education he wanted. 6 continents and a year later, Alan found himself in the bitter cold of the south pole.
	Alan walked alone. It wasn’t that he didn’t like traveling with people. They just slowed him down. And so, Alan pushed ahead. He crested the ridge of ice and looked out into the distance. Ice. More and more ice. He stretched and felt a buzz in his pocket. His gloved hands fumbled with sealed zippers until he pulled out a sleek, modern phone. Good old RellenTech. Satellites and cell around the globe. He pressed the answer button and put the device to his ear. A cheery, soft voice rang through.
	“Hey there, honey! How’s the cold?” Alan smiled. Of course Amelia would call him when she knew he’s hiking through the heart of Antarctica. That woman.
	“You know, most girlfriends don’t call their men when they’re in the coldest place on earth. Have you ever thought of that?”
	“Nope! Hey, I wanted to ask your opinion. I have a pretty important decision in front of me and I don’t know what to do.”
	“What’s up?”
	“I can’t decide if I should get a ‘lavender honey’ candle, or a ‘lapping waves.’ I have your parents coming over tomorrow and I don’t know what they like more. Help a girlfriend out, would you?”
	“Lavender honey. Definitely lavender honey.”
	“Great, thanks! Send me a postcard when you can. I’ll see you in a week! Love you!”
	“See you in a week, Amelia. Love you!”
He hung up the phone and he slipped it into his pocket. He rolled his eyes and smiled. “Candles,” he muttered to himself as he started down the hill.
Alan reached the bottom of the valley 2 hours later. The wind had begun to whip him around. He used his poles and trudged on. It had taken him far longer to push on than expected. Maybe the scientists had been wise. The weather was bad. Not horrible, though. He pushed on for another hour, but the sky began to grow dark and clouds gathered. Snow began to fall and the wind picked up. He continued to push through, until it was nearly impossible to walk. Alan steadied himself on his pole, but it blew out from under him. He crashed onto his side, breathing heavily. “I can make it back,” he growled, through blue lips. He got onto his knees and began to crawl in the direction of the base. At least, as far as he could remember the direction. He sludged forward, pushing through snow and ice as he pushed on. His goggles iced over soon, and he tore them off. It didn’t do much. Everything was white. White above. White below. White behind. Blue ahead. Blue? In front of Alan, maybe 30 feet in the distance, a small patch of blue glowed. He crawled towards it. It was a beacon, a light pole set into the ice for vehicles and satellites to track. He was nearly there. 20 feet. 15 feet. 10. He was nearly there. His eyes burned from the cold. He scraped towards the strange blue glow. He finally made it. It wasn’t a beacon. It was the ice. A small patch of ice was steadily glowing a light blue. It seemed almost infused with that strange light. Alan wiped his face and peered closer. It wasn’t like anything he’d ever seen. He looked closer. It seemed to pulse brighter. He slipped a small ice pick from his belt. It slipped from his numb fingers. He gripped it again, holding with all his might, and struck the ice. It chipped the surface. He swung again, and again, and again, until the ice cracked deeply. The pick fell from his hand, forgotten. He peered down into the crack. It pulsed brightly, then his vision flashed a hot white and faded to black.

	Alan woke in a hospital bed. He jerked awake, and scanned his surroundings. He was in a white room. Hospital. Before he could move, a hand pushed him back down. He looked around and found Amelia standing over him, smiling. Her auburn hair hung down towards his face, and she kissed him on the forehead as he sank into the pillow. 
	“Hello, love. You seem to have gotten into a fight with the South Pole. And you lost.” He smiled. “Well, you can’t win them all. Not even me.” She leaned in for a hug, and they embraced. 
“How long have I been out?” Alan asked.
“A week,” sighed Amelia. Alan’s parents arrived moments later. Katrina, his mother, gave him a hug and told him how worried she’d been. His father shook his hand. 
“Good to see you alive, son.”
“Thanks, dad.”
“You’re not going to stop your adventures, are you?”
“Nope.”
“As I thought. Try not to die next time, will you?”
“Only because you asked, dad.” The conversations continued, Alan recalling his story for another hour.  Eventually, Alan was released from the hospital several hours later with a clean bill of health. No concussion. No hypothermia. He arrived at home that night and clambered onto his couch. He turned on the TV, mindlessly watching the news. After a while, he started to feel…odd. Nauseous. He got to his feet. Something was wrong. At first, it simply felt like a little sickness. The closer he got to the bathroom, though, the more the feeling grew. By the time he made it to the toilet, he felt near to bursting. He threw the lid open and leaned over, vomit streaming out of his mouth. He closed his eyes and let his body do its thing. When he was done, though…something was off. There was ice in the toilet bowl. A lot of it. Alan leaned away from the porcelain seat, and where his hands had gripped, a thick layer of frost had built up.
“What in the world?” he muttered. He stood up sharply and his hand twitched. Ice streamed from his palm, layering the mat in a mound of frozen water.
“What!? Ahhh!” He turned, ice blasting again. And again. And again. He forced himself to hold still, closing his fists. Ice covered most of his bathroom. He stared down at his hands in horror. Then in awe. He closed his eyes and thrust his arm forward, focusing. Ice immediately generated from his palm, freezing the sink. When he willed it to stop, it stopped. It was almost like breathing. He tried again. And again. He began to smile. 
	Alan’s garage was a mess for the rest of the day. Ice covered half the walls. Drawings littered the work table, with ideas for costumes, names, and everything in between scattered across the surface. It had been hours. Hours of brainstorming. Hours of dreaming. Hours of glory. He drove to a clothing store and bought fabric. He looked up videos on how to sew. He designed his costume. It was glorious. The name was easy. It was natural. Captain Avalanche was about to become one of the most famous superheroes the world could know.
 *	*	*
	Alan cruised down the highway, foot on the gas. The suit was a little tight, but he gripped the wheel tightly and focused. His small radio on the dash was picking up a police broadcast. The tipoff on the bank robbery gave Alan ample time to get his Mustang running and onto the road. It’s not like he needed it after a while, though. The Savages weren’t the sneakiest of supervillain groups. Their makeshift armored van could be heard crashing down the road miles away, sirens heralding behind them. The police couldn’t do anything, though. The Savages were professionals. The situation required a superhero to deal with. Someone like Captain Avalanche.
Rubber gripped the asphalt as his car flew down the road, pursuing the chaos. He turned abruptly, tires screeching. A minivan lurched to a halt to stop from crashing into him. He hit it, trying to catch up to the chase. He flew by a smoking police car that had crashed into a light pole. His speed increased as he swerved through the sparse traffic. Most people were smart enough to get out of the way when a supervillain chase started. Not Alan. He could see the armored truck as he pulled closer, and he shifted his grip. Frost covered the space where his hands had held before. The villain’s vehicle pulled closer. 100 feet. 80. 50. 30. When they were within close enough range, he rolled down the window and leaned out. He kept his right arm on the wheel, trying to keep the car steady. As they reached the overpass, he focused and stretched out his arm. A torrent of ice blasted out from his palm, striking onto the back of the van. He aimed lower, keeping the stream steady, freezing the bottom of the bumper and shooting for the axle. The van lurched and skidded, then steadied itself. It hit the brakes. Alan frowned. Then he saw the roadblock. 
The ice on the back of the vehicle stopped the brakes and it careened into the roadblock up ahead, scraping against the guardrails on the side of the bridge as it smashed into a police car. The huge van came to a halt, a path of icy skid marks left in its wake. He slammed onto the brakes, and his mustang screeched to a halt. A boom rocked the car as a tire blew and the brake pad ground into the asphalt. The Mustang spun out and reached a stop 30 feet before the roadblock. Alan groaned and unbuckled, rolling out of the front seat. He hit the ground and staggered to his feet. Ahead, the back doors of the van thudded open. A hulking beast of a man leapt out, a mask shaped like a hog’s head over his face. Boar. The muscle of the Savages’ team. The gravel crunched beneath his feet as he crouched, looking for prey. He found Alan. He charged, thundering towards Captain Avalanche. The man had to be at least six and a half feet tall, maybe taller. By the looks of it, he was 300 pounds of pure muscle. He wore a sturdy leather vest that exposed his hairy, burly arms. Avalanche couldn’t see his face. But he was angry. 
Alan pushed himself to his feet and thrust out his hands. He focused. Immediately, two forceful jets of ice blasted from his palms. The freezing streams took the man in the chest, sending him flying. He smashed into a car door and flipped over the sedan, a huge mass of ice encasing his chest. He struggled to his feet and flexed. The ice cracked, spiderweb fissures layering the buildup. Captain Avalanche sent another jet at him, but he ducked behind the car. A moment later, Alan heard the ice shatter. Boar heaved himself over the car, leaping towards Avalanche. Alan ran forward, blasting the mobile target with more jets of ice. He propelled Boar past him, and the large man landed on a truck with a crunch. The ice on him broke off and he pulled himself to his feet. 
“Freeze this, you freak!” bellowed the man as he slid down the car, dodging another torrent of ice, and ripped the door from the frame of the vehicle. He used it to block the next fountain of frozen water. He charged. Avalanche focused, and used both his hands to send a hugely powerful spray of ice towards Boar. It hit his makeshift shield and forced him back, building a mound of ice on the door. Alan held the stream. And held it. Boar grunted, then let go of the door, leaping to the side at just the right time. The truck was suddenly overcome with a tsunami of icy casing. Boar rolled to his feet and sprang towards Alan, pushing off of another car. A blast of ice took him in the face. Alan smiled. 
“Not so bad, if I say so myself,” he muttered. Then he heard the gunshot. Alan was knocked to his side as the slug grazed his ribs. “Dang it,” he grunted as he hit the asphalt. A second Savage climbed out of the van, wearing a dog mask. He was limping and carrying a shotgun. Hound. Second member of the Savages. He pumped the action and fired again. Alan was ready this time, already hiding behind a car’s bumper. He sent a jet of ice that the thinner man dodged. A third bullet skimmed off the hood and Avalanche sprang forward, freezing Hound’s feet in a diving lunge. 
“Freeze, Savage!” He rolled to his feet and sent a jet at the man’s shoulder, further encasing him. Another beam of ice took the man in the stomach. Alan was raising his arm for his fourth attack when Boar grabbed him from behind. The man had an arm on Alan’s shoulder and jacket. He hurled Avalanche backwards, throwing him into the car he’d been hiding behind. Alan bounced off the front with a crunch. He could feel one of his ribs crack. He stood slowly, coughing. 
“Calm down, big man. You’re not competing for the longest thrown human award.” Boar just growled, charging again. Alan ducked and sent a punch right into the man’s stomach. Just below the ribs, where there wasn't any bone to stop his fist. He swung with everything he had, driving his punch home. It practically bounced off. Boar gave no indication he even felt the punch. It probably hurt Alan more than it did the beast. His punch followed, and Alan could see the man’s smile through his mask holes. Boar’s knuckles connected with Avalanche’s face with the approximate velocity of a freight train. Alan crumpled to the ground, and through his dazed vision he saw Hound breaking free from the last of the ice. Some of it had been shot off, by the looks of it. Hound grabbed Alan’s neck, lifting him up. A punch knocked the air out of Avalanche’s lungs. He blinked, coughing. 
“Wait,” called Hound, his nasally voice ringing oddly in Alan’s ears. Boar turned toward him, dragging Alan with him.
“What? I’m just gonna snap the rat’s neck.”
“No, you idiot. You killed the last bank guard. The deal was I get to kill any supers we find on the road.”
“I don’t remember that,” muttered Boar, raising Alan again.
“Put him down, you animal,”
“We’re all animals, stupid. It’s in the name!”
“Oh, shut up,” sneered Hound, and the sentence was followed with another pump of the shotgun. Boar sighed and dropped Avalanche to his knees. Alan opened his eyes in time to feel the barrel of the shotgun rest on his chest. He grabbed it, holding it there. 
“Any last words, one-timer?”
“Yeah,” said Alan, frost ever so subtly covering the barrel of the gun. “Like I told you before…freeze.” He shoved the gun away, pushing it back towards Hound. The robber pulled the trigger a fraction of a second after the barrel was away from Avalanche’s body. The gun exploded. The barrel had been completely full of ice by the time Alan had moved it, and the dense material had apparently jammed the bullet sufficiently. The shrapnel blew everywhere, cutting gashes into Alan’s right arm and torso. Hound’s hand was a bloody, burnt mess. Captain Avalanche sprang into action, covering Hound’s head in a jet of ice and turning towards Boar. He took the brute’s shoulder before he could respond, and crashed against the car behind him. The wrestler held his arms, pinning him. Avalanche kicked at him, to no avail. He took a headbutt to the face. His nose bled profusely. Grunting, he grabbed Boar’s wrists and froze. The man gripped harder as ice built up to his shoulder, slowly weighing him down. In a burst of movement, Avalanche broke free, kicking Boar in the chest and layering him in a huge jet of ice. He didn’t let up until the man was stuck fast. Alan turned towards Hound, but the man was out of commission. He breathed a sigh of relief and tried to massage some feeling back into his wrists. He turned towards the van just in time to see another Savage getting out. This one’s mask depicted a man’s face, but a feral, crazy man’s. Unnatural grin. Feathered headdress. Wildman was easily recognizable as the gang’s leader. He shot Alan in the side before he could do anything about it. 
Alan dropped to the ground, groaning. Blood began to pour from his wound. He gritted his teeth against the pain and blasted Wildman with ice. The leader dodged behind the van, but Alan didn’t let up. He let his power loose, pouring as much ice out as he could. The van was soon encased fully, and the road became slick with the frozen water. He waited until he couldn’t hear the man’s breathing, then got to his feet. His car was totaled. His body was wrecked. But he was alive.
