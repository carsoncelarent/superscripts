<h1>Captain Avalanche</h1>
<h2>Issue #1</h2>

<div class="location">
AMD Base, Outpost 05<br>
122 Miles Southeast of New Sanden
</div>

<p>
“Give me the report, Carmen. I’m getting calls from the governor, the military, the news, and some ambassador from Zimbabwe or somewhere like that. Why the hell does the Colvon Street overpass look like a giant popsicle right now?”
</p>

<p>
Charlemagne Wester hurried down the crisp metal hallway leading to the observation room. A guard opened the door as he walked through, letting the Commander-in-Chief and his secretary inside.
</p>

<p>
“We’re just getting information now, sir. Reports claim a masked individual attempted to chase down the Savages’ getaway car in a light gray Ford Mustang. Both vehicles pulled to a stop due to traffic. The masked man exited his car and blasted them with ice of some sort that he projected from his palms. After a struggle — which ended up encasing a large portion of the overpass in ice — the Savages were subdued and he slipped away.”
</p>

<p>
“Did you track his car?”
</p>

<p>
“His car was wrecked in the chase. He escaped on foot before our drones could follow and disappeared.”
</p>

<p>
“Plates?”
</p>

<p>
“He’s either paranoid or smart enough to have pulled them off. It must have been recent.”
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wester gritted his teeth. Carmen blushed slightly under his ire.
</p>

<p>
“Find him. I don’t want another masked vigilante running around the biggest city in the states without supervision.”
</p>

<p>
Carmen nodded. A small smile crossed her face.
</p>

<p>
“He did stop the Savages, though.”
</p>

<p>
“…Yes he did. But I can’t thank him if I don’t know who he is.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes sir.”
</p>

<h2>Three Weeks Earlier</h2>

<div class="location">
Antarctica<br>
Near Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station
</div>

<p>
Alan Skears trudged through the cold. The bitter cold.
</p>

<p>
The Antarctic chill tried to seep through his jacket, but he pressed on. The scientists at the base had warned him not to go out today. The weather was too dangerous.
</p>

<p>
They didn’t know Alan well enough.
</p>

<p>
Alan wasn’t a scientist — much to his parents’ dismay. He’d earned an engineering degree from MIT only after his father threatened to cut him off financially. Some called his lifestyle reckless. Rash.
</p>

<p>
Alan preferred <em>adventurous</em>.
</p>

<p>
Six continents and a year later, he found himself at the bottom of the world.
</p>

<p>
He crested a ridge of ice. Endless white stretched before him.
</p>

<p>
His phone buzzed.
</p>

<p>
“Hey there, honey! How’s the cold?”
</p>

<p>
“You know most girlfriends don’t call their men when they’re hiking through the coldest place on Earth.”
</p>

<p>
“Lavender honey or lapping waves candle?”
</p>

<p>
Alan laughed.
</p>

<p>
“Lavender honey. Definitely lavender honey.”
</p>

<p>
“Great! Love you!”
</p>

<p>
“Love you too.”
</p>

<p>
Two hours later, the storm hit.
</p>

<p>
Wind howled. Snow blinded him. The world turned white.
</p>

<p>
Then he saw blue.
</p>

<p>
Thirty feet ahead, something glowed.
</p>

<p>
He crawled toward it.
</p>

<p>
It wasn’t a beacon.
</p>

<p>
It was the ice itself.
</p>

<p>
A patch pulsed with strange blue light.
</p>

<p>
He struck it with his ice pick.
</p>

<p>
Again.
</p>

<p>
Again.
</p>

<p>
The crack deepened.
</p>

<p>
The glow intensified.
</p>

<p>
Then—
</p>

<p>
White.
</p>

<div class="scene-break">* * *</div>

<p>
Alan woke in a hospital bed.
</p>

<p>
Amelia stood over him, smiling.
</p>

<p>
“You seem to have gotten into a fight with the South Pole. And you lost.”
</p>

<p>
He grinned.
</p>

<p>
“You can’t win them all.”
</p>

<p>
A week later, he was home.
</p>

<p>
That’s when the vomiting started.
</p>

<p>
Ice filled the toilet bowl.
</p>

<p>
Frost crept across porcelain.
</p>

<p>
Ice streamed from his palm.
</p>

<p>
He froze the sink.
</p>

<p>
Stopped.
</p>

<p>
Did it again.
</p>

<p>
Again.
</p>

<p>
And then he smiled.
</p>

<h2>Captain Avalanche</h2>

<p>
The garage became a laboratory of ambition.
</p>

<p>
Design sketches. Fabric rolls. Sewing tutorials.
</p>

<p>
A name.
</p>

<p>
Captain Avalanche.
</p>

<p>
Natural. Inevitable.
</p>

<div class="scene-break">* * *</div>

<p>
The Mustang roared down the highway.
</p>

<p>
Police radio chatter crackled.
</p>

<p>
The Savages were on the move.
</p>

<p>
A makeshift armored van tore through traffic.
</p>

<p>
Alan leaned out the window.
</p>

<p>
Ice erupted from his palm.
</p>

<p>
The van skidded.
</p>

<p>
Brakes screamed.
</p>

<p>
Roadblock ahead.
</p>

<p>
Impact.
</p>

<p>
The Mustang spun out.
</p>

<p>
Boar emerged from the van.
</p>

<p>
Six and a half feet of muscle.
</p>

<p>
Leather vest.
</p>

<p>
Hog mask.
</p>

<p>
Avalanche raised both hands.
</p>

<p>
Twin jets of ice slammed into the brute.
</p>

<p>
Metal doors ripped free.
</p>

<p>
Ice built like a glacier.
</p>

<p>
Gunshot.
</p>

<p>
Hound entered the fight.
</p>

<p>
Shotgun.
</p>

<p>
Blast.
</p>

<p>
Ice jammed the barrel.
</p>

<p>
Explosion.
</p>

<p>
Blood.
</p>

<p>
Chaos.
</p>

<p>
Wildman stepped from the van.
</p>

<p>
He shot Alan in the side.
</p>

<p>
Avalanche roared.
</p>

<p>
Ice flooded the bridge.
</p>

<p>
The van disappeared under frozen casing.
</p>

<p>
Silence returned to the overpass.
</p>

<p>
His car was totaled.
</p>

<p>
His ribs ached.
</p>

<p>
Blood soaked his suit.
</p>

<p>
But he was alive.
